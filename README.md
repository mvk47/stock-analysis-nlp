# stock-analysis-nlp

The stock market analysis project uses Natural Language Processing to analyse news articles and predict the value of a stock. To implement this project I used News API and Yahoo API for data extraction. I used Python for preprocessing of the data. Vandersentiment was used to calculate the sentiment of the news articles. The project used multiple machine learning models to get the accuracy of the prediction.
